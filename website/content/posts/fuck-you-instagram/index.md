The time has come. I set up a website for my film photography project.
I'm into film photography for a few years now, but I only treat it as a side quest,
when I don't feel like it I don't take pictures, sometimes even a few months. 
Anyway, I've always wanted to have a place to show them. It took me some time to find
the right solution, because I didn't want to build a website from scratch, but now it's
online baby.

Check it out [here][widmo].

Now I can officialy say: **Fuck you Instagram, I don't need you anymore.**
