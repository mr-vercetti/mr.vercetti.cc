## Hey there!

I'm `mr-vercetti`, a regular nerdy guy from Poland. I created this website to be able
to share my hobbies with others and not use bloated centralised social media platforms.
I can do whatever I want here, without ads and other crap.

This is my place in the World Wide Web. It's a very nice feeling to have
one.

## What will be posted here?

I intend to write something from time to time about my interests, which are:
- Computers, self-hosting, software
- Internet culture
- PC games
- Movies
- Film  photography
- Music, audio setups, vinyl
- Literature

## More about me

When it comes to pop culture, I love the classic stuff, but I also can appreciate the new.
I spend a lot of my free time in front of the computer, but that doesn't mean it's "productive".
I'm not a fan of forced productivity. Sometimes I just like to sit and install
mods for GTA Vice City or tinker at my homelab.

## My job and tech projects

My job is quite an important part of my life because it connects with my interests
and gives me a lot of satisfaction. However, I'm not some kind of tech-guru, and
I'm still learning. Keep that in mind when you browse my [projects][gitea]!
