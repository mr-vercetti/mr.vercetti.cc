## Hey there!

I'm `mr-vercetti`, a regular nerdy guy from Europe. I created this website to be able
to share my hobbies with others and not use bloated centralised social media platforms.
I can do whatever I want here, without ads and other crap.

This is my place in the World Wide Web. It's a very nice feeling to have
one.

## All right, but what will be posted here?

I intend to write something from time to time about what turns me on, which is:

- Tinkering with computers
- Self-hosting
- Playing classic video games
- Watching classic movies
- Old PC hardware
- My job
- Weird stuff from the Internet

## By the way, more about me...
I make my living as DevOps Engineer. I love classic/retro/old stuff, but I also
appreciate the new. I spend most of my free time in front of the computer but
that doesn't mean it's "productive". I'm not a fan of forced productivity.
Sometimes I just like to sit and install mods for Vice City.

## My job and my own projects

My job is quite an important part of my life because it connects with my passions
and gives me a lot of satisfaction. However, I'm not some kind of tech-guru, and
I'm still learning a lot of the basics. Keep that in mind when you browse my
[projects][gitea]!
