## Hey there!

I'm `mr-vercetti`, a regular nerdy guy from Europe. I created this website to be able
to share my hobbies with others and not use bloated centralised social media platforms.
I can do whatever I want here, without ads and other crap.

This is my place in the World Wide Web. It's a very nice feeling to have
one.

## All right, but what will be posted here?

I intend to write something from time to time about what turns me on, which is:

- Self-hosting
- Tinkering with computers
- My job
- PC Games
- Movies, TV shows
- Film  photography
- Art in any other form (fashion, architecture, music, literature)
- Weird stuff from the Internet

## By the way, more about me...

When it comes to pop culture, I love the classic stuff, but also appreciate the new.
I spend a lot of my free time in front of the computer but that doesn't mean it's "productive".
I'm not a fan of forced productivity. Sometimes I just like to sit and install
mods for GTA Vice City. I'm interested in new technologies and enjoy typing
commands in the terminal, so I work as a DevOps Engineer.

## My job and my own tech projects

My job is quite an important part of my life because it connects with my passions
and gives me a lot of satisfaction. However, I'm not some kind of tech-guru, and
I'm still learning a lot of the basics. Keep that in mind when you browse my
[projects][gitea]!
