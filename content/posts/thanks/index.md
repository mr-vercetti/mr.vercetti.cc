This is my first post on this website, so I would like to take this opportunity to thank a few people
whose works have influenced me recently or who are simply cool.

- [Thomas Pain][thomas-pain] for his [manifesto][manifesto], after reading which I wanted
to have my own website and which I fully agree with.
- [Wolfgang][wolfgang] for his cool [yt channel][wolfgang-yt] thanks to which I have become familiar
 with many interesting issues and technologies (including [Zola][zola], on which this site is based).
- [FIGBERT][figbert] for creating a veeery decent [d3c3nt Zola theme][d3c3nt], which this
  site also uses.
- [Silent][silent] for a whole bunch of excellent patches for old PC games.
- [ThirteenAG][thirteenag] for all your magnificent [Widescreen Fixes][thirteenag-widescreen-fixes].

Thank you very much guys! You made my life better.
